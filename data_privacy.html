            <p>Intro (P1): When did it come out? What is their goal? Seems exciting but... </p>
            
            <p>On September 5th, Google rolled out a new feature that had many researchers and Open Science proponents cheering: a dataset search. Previously, searching for usable data was often a nearly impossible task that limited data-driven discoveries. Now, with this addition to Google's interface, users can find hundreds of datasets relating to any simple keyword in a matter of seconds.</p>
            
            <p>Nutgraph (P2): Where is the line between accessibility and privacy? It's important to find a happy medium. I have experience with my own work with datasets</p>
            
            <p>Improvements to data accessibility like this are widely celebrated, and for good reason. It is becoming increasingly important to use data in research across all disciplines. But why has it been so difficult for so long to find appropriate data? For one reason, extra privacy measures restrict immediate access. Google has been <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/search/making-it-easier-discover-datasets/">explicit</a> about the purpose of this feature, stating "dataset Search lets you find datasets wherever they’re hosted, whether it’s a publisher's site, a digital library, or an author's personal web page." It seems they are looking to avoid bypassing those privacy measures or documentation provided by the data's host. But while their intentions are clear, we do not yet know how successful they might be. Discovering the delicate balance of data accessibility and privacy is a relevant and timely conversation, and one that everyone, from single researchers to companies like Google, must continually address. </p> 
            <!--Through this feature, Google is successfully walking the line between data access and data privacy. -->

            <p>P3: Taxonomy of publicly available datasets. Some are walled off!</p>
            
            <p>Online datasets come in all different forms. Some are in excel formats, some are HTML, others are in formats few have ever heard of. Certain data are messy and can even be mostly unusable while others are ready for analysis. The source for datasets found online also vary greatly. Obvious places include government, colleges and university, and large research center sites. </p>

            <p>P4: Usability study -- Choose search terms, # of results (approximately), types of results, try clicking on some and detail what google offers!</p>
            
            <p>In order to properly test the  newfeature, I decided to take a somewhat systematic approach for investigation. First, I chose a broad subject to search. Having worked in the Office of Institutional Research at Smith College, my first term was "higher education". Unlike in their normal commercial search, Google does not provide the number of results at the top, nor does it include pages at the bottom. Instead, a scrolling list of datasets appear on the lefthand side of the screen. After scrolling down to the bottom, I would estimate the resulrs include </p>

            <p>P5: FLASHE not on google dataset search because it has a user agreement. Here is where I will introduce my work- "Like Google, my goal was to make these data more accesible..." BUT, it comes with a cost of privacy. And I can't ignore that.</p>

            <!-- <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2> -->

            <p>P6: Point is: each dataset comes with its own threshold of privacy. Google is specifically making it easier to find, not just bypassing certain walls and levels of privacy <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/5/17822562/google-dataset-search-service-scholar-scientific-journal-open-data-access">(good!)</a></p>

            <p>P7: What I learned is, I cannot make the data more accesible with out compromising privacy- so I cannot cross that line, and I cannot continue with the project. </p>

            <!--<blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote> -->

            <p>P8: I'm not writing about an abstract issue: data provacy issues happen all the time. Look at this example from OKCupid...</p>

            <!--<h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2> -->

            <p>P9: As data scientists/researchers we must remember what the effects of our work are on privacy. We must find that line and not cross it. Then, we must encourage others to do the same.</p>
