            <p>Intro (P1): When did it come out? What is their goal? Seems exciting but... </p>
            
            <p>On September 5th, Google rolled out a new feature that had many researchers and Open Science proponents cheering: a dataset search. Previously, searching for usable data was often a nearly impossible task that limited data-driven discoveries. Now, with this addition to Google's interface, users can find hundreds of datasets relating to any simple keyword in a matter of seconds.</p>
            
            <p>Nutgraph (P2): Where is the line between accessibility and privacy? It's important to find a happy medium. I have experience with my own work with datasets</p>
            
            <p>Improvements to data accessibility like this are widely celebrated, and for good reason. It is becoming increasingly important to use data in research across all disciplines. But why has it been so difficult for so long to find appropriate data? For one reason, extra privacy measures restrict immediate access. Google has been <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/search/making-it-easier-discover-datasets/">explicit</a> about the purpose of this feature, stating "dataset Search lets you find datasets wherever they’re hosted, whether it’s a publisher's site, a digital library, or an author's personal web page." It seems they are looking to avoid bypassing those privacy measures or documentation provided by the data's host. But while their intentions are clear, we do not yet know how successful they might be. Discovering the delicate balance of data accessibility and privacy is a relevant and timely conversation, and one that everyone, from single researchers to companies like Google, must continually address. </p> 
            <!--Through this feature, Google is successfully walking the line between data access and data privacy. -->

            <p>P3: Taxonomy of publicly available datasets. Some are walled off!</p>
            
            <p>Online datasets come in all different forms. Some are in excel formats, some are HTML, others are in formats few have ever heard of. Certain data are messy and mostly unusable while others are ready for analysis. The source of datasets found online also varies greatly. Obvious places include government, colleges and university, and large research center sites. (this is boring, what else can I add) </p>

            <p>P4: Usability study -- Choose search terms, # of results (approximately), types of results, try clicking on some and detail what google offers!</p>
            
            <p>In order to properly test the  newfeature, I decided to take a somewhat systematic approach for investigation. First, I chose a broad subject to search. Having worked in the Office of Institutional Research at Smith College, my first term was "higher education". Unlike in their normal commercial search, Google does not provide the number of results at the top, nor does it include pages at the bottom. Instead, a scrolling list of datasets appear on the lefthand side of the screen. After scrolling down to the bottom, I would estimate the results to be around 200 datasets long. Though seemingly small, the data was available to me within seconds. Some of the first datasets listed included "Higher Education Student Data" from the Austrlian Government Educational statistics page and "Carnegie Commission National Survey of Higher Education: Undergraduate Study, 1969-1970". The next step I took was to narrow my search. The next term was "higher education retention", as I've learned that retention rates are an important indicator of institutional success. For this more specific search, only 35 datasets were listed. However, after looking closer, I noticed some of these did not even relate to higher education, for example, the dataset titled "Gallup Daily: U.S. Employee Engagement". While it may touch upon retention, there is certainly no relation to higher education.</p>

            <p>P5: FLASHE not on google dataset search because it has a user agreement. Here is where I will introduce my work- "Like Google, my goal was to make these data more accesible..." BUT, it comes with a cost of privacy. And I can't ignore that.</p>
            
            <p>What about datasets that weren't included in this list at all? During the past summer, I had been focusing research on one dataset of a study that is hidden behind a user agreement on the National Institute of Health's National Cancer Institute site. The study title is FLASHE (Family Life, Activity, Sun, Health, and Eating), which includes survey responses from parents and their adolescent children. I was introduced to this dataset through my advisor, and was likely not one I would have found on my own, especially given it's not avaiable through Dataset Search. </p>
            
           <p>The point being made here is not that Google's new search is flawed. Their algorithm is not able to bypass that extra privacy meaure and therefore cannot provide a direct link to the data. Basically, these data are private, mostly due to the nature of the responses. Google, given their recent move to improve accessibility, may want to brainstorm how to reach this data. I certainly can't blame them. I was drawn to a project with these data for a similar goal, to maximize it's usage. The data for the study was broken up into six files (three for parents and three for adolescents) and none were available in the ideal format for my analysis. I looked at the wrangling I had ahead of me and couldn't help but think about those who do not have the same data science skills but still hope to use FLASHE data. Thus, the project was born.</p>
           
           <p>The form of these data are standard dyadic, meaning that each person is linked to one and only one other person in the sample with both having been measured on the same variables. This breaks the independence assumption of standard linear regression. Therefore, in order to perform analyses, different, more complex models are necessary. In this case, a model known as the actor-partner independence model is standard. To run an APIM, the data must be in a specific format known as pairwise. (explain this somehow) Getting the data into this format is tricky, and requires a fairly high knowledge of data wrangling. To allow for further research using the results of the FLASHE study, I decided to create an application using the Shiny package in R. The point of the app is to let users to choose the format in which they want the data, the variables, then download in csv format. In order to make more informed decisions, a second tab in the app allows for basic exploratory data analyses which includes the codebook description of the variable chosen.</p>

            <span class="caption text-muted">A screenshot of the exploratory data analysis tab.</span>
           
           <p>The process of writing the app went well, only taking a few weeks during a summer fellowship to complete. Excited about our quick progress, my advisor and I contacted the investigators of the FLASHE study to discuss what we had done. After a brief phone conversation, we received an email telling us that they were unable to use our app and that public use of their data through the app does not apply with the user agreement I signed. Long story short, the app that I had created to make the data more accessible could not be shared by me or anyone else.</p>
            
            <!-- <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2> -->
            
            <p>What I learned through the experience was that sometimes, accessibility comes with the price of reduced privacy. I thought I was creating a helpful tool when instead, had I launched the app, I would have been making data public that is specifically behind a privacy wall. This was one of the first times I had personally encountered a project that required specific attention to data privacy. Though ethics has always been a part of my conversations as a data scientist, this experience made me accutely aware of the impact. Then, days later when Google introduced a feature with similar goals to mine with the FLASHE app, I couldn't help but be leery. It's comforting to see language specifying their intentions of the tool but will it's currently only in beta phase. What will the next addition be? And will it cross that privacy line?</p>
            
            <p>It might seem cynical to assume that a project with good intentions could take such a turn. But this isn't an abstract issue. There are issues with data privacy that begin with the intention of accessibility. Just two years ago, a group of researchers released a dataset containing information of users on OkCupid, an online dating website.    </p>
            
            <p>open science... I found out it went against privacy, had to stop, maybe I need to reconsider?</p>

            <p>P6: Point is: each dataset comes with its own threshold of privacy. Google is specifically making it easier to find, not just bypassing certain walls and levels of privacy <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/5/17822562/google-dataset-search-service-scholar-scientific-journal-open-data-access">(good!)</a></p>

            <p>P7: What I learned is, I cannot make the data more accesible with out compromising privacy- so I cannot cross that line, and I cannot continue with the project. </p>

            <!--<blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote> -->

            <p>P8: I'm not writing about an abstract issue: data provacy issues happen all the time. Look at this example from OKCupid...</p>

            <!--<h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2> -->

            <p>P9: As data scientists/researchers we must remember what the effects of our work are on privacy. We must find that line and not cross it. Then, we must encourage others to do the same.</p>
