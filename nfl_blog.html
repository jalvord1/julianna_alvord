<p>I’ve been watching football my whole life. Having grown up in New Jersey, My dad has been a Giants fan from the beginning. I spent a lot of my childhood sitting with him and watching Eli Manning and the rest of the team play. From their two Super Bowl upsets in 2008 and 2012 to lazy Sunday afternoons, I associate many positive memories with watching football. It has become obvious to me now that I was watching through rose-colored glasses. </p>

<p>My first experience questioning the sport of football and the NFL as an establishment came after watching the movie <a href = “http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/concussion/”>Concussion</a> in 2015. The movie tells the true story of Dr. Omalu, a forensic neuropathologist who made the first discovery of CTE, a football-related brain trauma, and fought the NFL to acknowledge its existence. Though shocked and saddened by the story at the time, I noticed the NFL actively taking steps towards reducing head injuries through contact restrictions and fines. I was naive to look the other way and assume the problem had been taken resolved.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until I got to college and took a class titled Body Images & Sports Media when I became truly wary of the issues surrounding sports media, mostly in regards to sexist and racist language directed towards athletes. For decades, <a href = “https://sports.vice.com/en_us/article/4x987d/sports-media-is-still-racist-against-black-athletes”>studies</a> have pointed out issues of racism in Sports media, a problem especially prevalent in Football. Despite the fact that over <a href = “https://qz.com/1287915/the-nfls-racial-makeup-explains-much-of-its-national-anthem-problems/”>65%</a> of players in the NFL are black, the vast majority of head coaches, league office personnel, and team CEOs/presidents are white. Additionally, most sports commentators are <a href = “http://nebula.wsimg.com/038bb0ccc9436494ebee1430174c13a0?AccessKeyId=DAC3A56D8FB782449D2A&disposition=0&alloworigin=1”>white</a>, meaning that the narratives of black players are often told exclusively from a white point of view.</p>

<p>The lack of diversity in sports media (and across all area of journalism) can perpetuate racist and uninformed conversations among fans, leading to a feedback loop which praises white and black players at <a href = “https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/107769907705400104?casa_token=kHBhZhF-g1AAAAAA%3Aq6TNVotzsKkr-uKvS8S3_UddXEfyex4k4LprWO51EPvk0w0Z_iOW2WHjY-dOsyVemjfP-Z1e3ixO”>disproportionate rates</a>.</p>
